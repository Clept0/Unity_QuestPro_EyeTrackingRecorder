# Eye Tracking Recorder for VR Headset with Unity
Introduction

   Welcome to the Eye Tracking Recorder repository! 
   This project focuses on creating a tool for VR headsets using Unity that records and analyzes eye movement with a MetaQuest.

Features

    Real-Time Eye Tracking: Capture and record eye movement data in real-time as users interact with the VR environment.
    Unity Integration: Seamless integration with Unity, allowing for easy implementation and customization in various VR projects.
    Data Visualization: Tools to visualize and analyze eye-tracking data as heatmap to understand user focus and attention.

Getting Started

    Prerequisites: Ensure you have the recommed version of Unity for this project: 2022.3.12f1 and a QuestLink compatible usb-wire.
    Installation: Clone this repo and open the project in Unity. Open the EyeTrackingRecoder scene under Scenes. Follow the setup instructions from the video to setup all correctly.
    Connect your Quest via USB and set any android device as remote under project settings. Start QuestLink on the Quest. 
    
    Running the Recorder: Navigate to the EyeTrackingRecoder scene and hit play. The tool will begin recording eye movement data once the VR headset is active.

Usage

    Recording Data: Simply wear the headset and interact with the VR environment. The tool will record all eye movement data.
    Analyzing Data: Use the included visualization as heatmap.
    Customize: all parameters can be found in the Heatmap Script with comments. Adjust the parameters as desired.
